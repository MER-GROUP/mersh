# vala
# Vala is a programming language that aims to bring modern programming
# language features to GNOME developers without imposing any additional
# runtime requirements and without using a different ABI compared to
# applications and libraries written in C.
# valac, the Vala compiler, is a self-hosting compiler that translates
# Vala source code into C source and header files. It uses the GObject
# type system to create classes and interfaces declared in the Vala source
# code.
